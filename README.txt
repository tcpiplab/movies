For Project 1 of the Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree
June 7, 2015


TO BUILD THE WEB PAGE:
To generate the Movie Trailers web page, run the entertainment_center.py file using a Python 2 interpreter such as the IDLE program or by doing this via the command line:

  python entertainment_center.py

Any version of Python 2 should work, but this project was created with 2.7.9.


FILES
There are three files total:

  entertainment_center.py
  media.py
  fresh_tomatoes.py

The media.py file contains the class definition for this project and should not be run on its own.

The fresh_tomatoes.py file was written by Udacity staff, with a few small HTML and CSS modifications by me for this project. Do not run this file on its own either.

The entertainment_center.py file imports the two above mentioned files and they must be located in the same directory as the entertainment_center.py file for it to run. Any Python 2 interpreter can be used to run this file. This will generate a web page for all the movies listed in the entertainment_center.py file. 

After generating the web page, the entertainment_center.py opens the generated web page in the default web browser. Clicking on any movie poster will load that movie's trailer in an HTML video player
